In CSS, the calc() method is used to perform calculations to determine property values dynamically. 
However, calc() itself doesn't directly repeat or animate. 
When combined with CSS timing functions (like in animations or transitions),
 it can be used to calculate positions, sizes, etc., while the repetition or timing is handled by the animation or transition rules.

 ðŸ’¡ Breakdown
calc(100% - 100px) calculates the distance from the left edge of the container to move the box to the far right (while considering the box width).

animation: moveBox 2s ease-in-out infinite; makes it repeat infinitely every 2 seconds.

ease-in-out is the timing function, which controls the speed curve.


ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases for calc() in Animations or Repeats
Moving elements based on dynamic container sizes

Resizing elements responsively

Adjusting positions inside a looped animation
