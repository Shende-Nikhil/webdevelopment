The aspect-ratio property allows you to define the ratio between width and height of an element.

If aspect-ratio and width properties are set, the height will follow in the defined aspect ratio.

Tip: Use the aspect-ratio property in responsive layouts where elements often vary in size and you want to preserve the ratio between width and height.
