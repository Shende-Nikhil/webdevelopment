The CSS ::placeholder pseudo-element is used to style the placeholder text of  <input> or <textarea> elements.

The placeholder text is set with the placeholder attribute, which specifies a hint that describes the expected value of the field.

Tip: The default color of the placeholder text is light grey in most browsers.
