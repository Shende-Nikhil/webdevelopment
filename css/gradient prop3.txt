CSS defines three types of gradients:

1) Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
2) Radial Gradients (defined by their center)
3) Conic Gradients (rotated around a center point)

1-> CSS Linear Gradients (up/down/right/diagonally)
 To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops.
 Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among.
 You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.

Syntax
background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...);


2-> CSS Radial Gradients  (defined by their center)
A radial gradient is defined by its center.

To create a radial gradient you must also define at least two color stops.

Syntax
background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at position, start-color, ..., last-color);

By default, shape is ellipse, size is farthest-corner, and position is center.

3-> CSS Conic Gradients (rotated around a center point)
A conic gradient is a gradient with color transitions rotated around a center point.

To create a conic gradient you must define at least two colors.

Syntax
background-image: conic-gradient([from angle] [at position,] color [degree], color [degree], ...);
By default, angle is 0deg and position is center.

If no degree is specified, the colors will be spread equally around the center point.
