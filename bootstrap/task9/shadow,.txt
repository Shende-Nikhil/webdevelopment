Shadows:-

Add or remove shadows to elements with box-shadow utilities.
In Bootstrap, shadows are a visual effect applied to components to create a sense of depth and layering. 
Bootstrap offers utility classes to easily add or remove shadows,
and these classes can be used to control the size and appearance of the shadow. 
By default, shadows are disabled in Bootstrap and can be enabled by setting 
the $enable-shadows Sass variable to true or by using the utility classes directly.

Examples 
While shadows on components are disabled by default in Bootstrap and can be enabled via $enable-shadows, 
you can also quickly add or remove a shadow with our box-shadow utility classes.
Includes support for .shadow-none and three default sizes (which have associated variables to match).

1-No shadow
2-Small shadow
3-Regular shadow
4-Larger shadow
