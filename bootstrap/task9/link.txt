Link:-
Link utilities are used to stylize your anchors to adjust their 
color, opacity, underline offset, underline color, and more.

Link opacity :-
Change the alpha opacity of the link rgba() color value with utilities. 
Please be aware that changes to a color’s opacity can lead to links with insufficient contrast.

Link underlines :-
Underline color 
Change the underline’s color independent of the link text color.

Colored links :-
Colored link helpers have been updated to pair with our link utilities. 
Use the new utilities to modify the link opacity, underline opacity, and underline offset.

Hover variants :-
Just like the 
.link-opacity-*-hover utilities,
.link-offset and 
.link-underline-opacity 
utilities include :hover variants by default.
Mix and match to create unique link styles.
