Overview :-
These utility classes float an element to the left or right, or disable floating,
 based on the current viewport size using the CSS float property. 
 !important is included to avoid specificity issues. 
 These use the same viewport breakpoints as our grid system. 
 Please be aware float utilities have no effect on flex items.

Float start on all viewport sizes
Float end on all viewport sizes
Don’t float on all viewport sizes

Float end on viewports sized MD (medium) or wider

Float end on viewports sized LG (large) or wider

Float end on viewports sized XL (extra large) or wider

Important Notes:
These classes are based on the CSS float property and can be used in conjunction with other Bootstrap classes like the grid system. 
Float utilities will not affect flex items. 
Bootstrap's float utilities are designed to be simple and easy to use for common layout tasks, 
but for more complex layouts, using flexbox or grid may be more appropriate.
