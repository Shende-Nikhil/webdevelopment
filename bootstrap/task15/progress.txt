In Bootstrap, the Progress component is used to display the progress of a task or process. It provides a visual representation using progress bars that can be styled and customized.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features of Bootstrap Progress
Base Progress Bar:

1-Uses .progress as the container.

.progress-bar is the child element that shows the actual progress.

Width is controlled using inline styles or utility classes (e.g., style="width: 50%;").

2-Striped Progress Bars:

Add .progress-bar-striped to make the bar display stripes.

Stripes are purely visual and donâ€™t indicate activity unless animated.

3-Animated Progress Bars:

Add .progress-bar-animated along with .progress-bar-striped.

Creates a looping animation effect to indicate ongoing activity.

4-Multiple Bars:

You can include multiple .progress-bar elements inside one .progress container.

Useful to show different segments of a whole.

5-Contextual Variants:

Bootstrap supports contextual classes like .bg-success, .bg-info, .bg-warning, .bg-danger, etc.

These change the color of the progress bar to match the context.

6- Labels:

You can add text inside the progress bar to show percentage or other info.

Text should be placed inside the .progress-bar.

Height Customization:

The default height is small, but you can increase it by applying custom height using utility classes like style="height: 20px;".

7- Accessibility:

Use aria-* attributes (aria-valuenow, aria-valuemin, aria-valuemax) to improve accessibility.

Helps screen readers convey progress information to visually impaired users.

**-How it works 
Progress components are built with two HTML elements, some CSS to set the width, and a few attributes. We donâ€™t use the HTML5 <progress> element, ensuring you can stack progress bars, animate them, and place text labels over them.

We use the .progress as a wrapper to indicate the max value of the progress bar.
The .progress wrapper also requires a role="progressbar" and aria attributes to make it accessible, including an accessible name (using aria-label, aria-labelledby, or similar).
We use the inner .progress-bar purely for the visual bar and label.
The .progress-bar requires an inline style, utility class, or custom CSS to set its width.
We provide a special .progress-stacked class to create multiple/stacked progress bars.
