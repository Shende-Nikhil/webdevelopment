ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts of Bootstrap Placeholders
Purpose:

To show a temporary UI representation while actual content (like text, images, buttons) is loading.

Enhances perceived performance and improves user experience.

1- Class Usage:

Uses the .placeholder class to create placeholder elements.

Additional utility classes help define size, color, animation, and shape.

2- Types of Placeholders:

Text placeholders: Simulate loading text or paragraphs.

Button/image placeholders: Simulate interactive components or visuals.

Grid/card placeholders: Often used in cards or list items to maintain layout.

3- Animation Support:

.placeholder-glow: Creates a subtle glowing animation.

.placeholder-wave: Creates a wave-like shimmer animation effect.

These make placeholders feel more dynamic and responsive.

4- Sizing and Shape:

Placeholder elements can adopt sizing classes like .col-*, .w-*, .h-*, etc.

Can also be made rounded (.rounded) or circle (.rounded-circle) for avatar-like placeholders.

5- Color Customization:

Colors can be adjusted using contextual text color classes like .bg-primary, .bg-secondary, etc.

6- Responsiveness:

Placeholders are responsive and can be easily integrated into Bootstrapâ€™s grid system and 
components like cards, lists, and tables.

7- Accessibility Consideration:

Use aria-hidden="true" on placeholder elements.

Ensure screen readers do not treat placeholders as real content.

ðŸ”¸ Common Use Cases
Content loading in cards, modals, or tables

Simulating form fields before data loads

Skeleton screens for apps or dashboards

**- How it works 
Create placeholders with the .placeholder class and a grid column class (e.g., .col-6) to set the width.
 They can replace the text inside an element or be added as a modifier class to an existing component.

We apply additional styling to .btns via ::before to ensure the height is respected. You may extend this pattern for other situations as needed,
 or add a &nbsp; within the element to reflect the height when actual text is rendered in its place.
