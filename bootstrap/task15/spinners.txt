⚙️ Customization Options
Colors

Spinners use Bootstrap’s text color utilities (e.g., text-primary, text-success) 
to apply different theme colors.

1- Size

Use .spinner-border-sm or .spinner-grow-sm for smaller versions.

You can also set custom sizes with inline styles or utility classes like width and height.

2- Alignment

Use utilities like d-flex, justify-content-center, and align-items-center to position spinners.

3- Buttons

Spinners can be placed inside buttons to indicate a loading state.

Often used with disabled buttons to prevent duplicate submissions.

🧠 Accessibility
Always include a visually hidden element like <span class="visually-hidden">Loading...</span> for screen readers.
