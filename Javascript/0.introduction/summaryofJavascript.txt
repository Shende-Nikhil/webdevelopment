1>DEFINE:->
JavaScript is a versatile, dynamically typed programming language that brings life to web pages by making them interactive. 
It is used for building interactive web applications,
supports both client-side and server-side development, 
and integrates seamlessly with HTML, CSS, and a rich standard library.

JavaScript is a single-threaded language that executes one task at a time.
It is an interpreted language which means it executes the code line by line.
The data type of the variable is decided at run-time in JavaScript, which is why it is called dynamically typed.

2>Key Features of JavaScript:->

Here are some key features of JavaScript that make it a powerful language for web development:

Client-Side Scripting:JavaScript runs on the user's browser, so has a faster response time without needing to communicate with the server.
Versatile: JavaScript can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple calculations to complex server-side applications.
Event-Driven: JavaScript can respond to user actions (clicks, keystrokes) in real-time.
Asynchronous: JavaScript can handle tasks like fetching data from servers without freezing the user interface.
Rich Ecosystem: There are numerous libraries and frameworks built on JavaScript, 
such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which make development faster and more efficient.

3>JavaScript's flexibility extends to both the client-side and server-side, allowing developers to create complete web applications. 
Here’s how it functions in each environment:

Client-Side:

Involves controlling the browser and its DOM (Document Object Model).
Handles user events like clicks and form inputs.
Common libraries include AngularJS, ReactJS, and VueJS.

Server-Side:

Involves interacting with databases, manipulating files, and generating responses.
Node.js and frameworks like Express.
js are widely used for server-side JavaScript, enabling full-stack development.
